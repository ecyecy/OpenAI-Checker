# OpenAI-Checker
Used to check if your IP can access OpenAI services.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **With the update of OpenAI's strategy, this script may no longer be accurate. (May 29, 2023)**

## Detection method
Our detection results come from **Cloudflare** and the accuracy is independent of this script.   

At present, there are 163 countries supported, and I will continue to update the countries and regions newly supported by OpenAI. (April 5, 2023)

## Usage
```shell
bash <(curl -Ls (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecyecy/OpenAI-Checker/main/openai.sh))
```
## Result
